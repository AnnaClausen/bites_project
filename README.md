# bites_project

> An application built using django and python for restaurant owners to track ingredient inventory, menu items and purchases.
 
## Demo


## Features
1. Users can enter in new recipes along with their recipe requirements, and how much that menu item costs.
2. They can also add to the inventory a name of an ingredient, its price per unit, and how much of that item is available.
3. They can enter in a customer purchase of a menu item. When a customer purchases an item off the menu, the inventory should be modified to accommodate what happened, as well as recording the time that the purchase was made.
